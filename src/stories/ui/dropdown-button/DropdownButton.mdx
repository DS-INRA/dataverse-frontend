# Dropdown Button

A dropdown button is a graphical user interface element that displays a list of options when it is clicked.

Dropdown buttons can be used to present a compact and organized set of choices to the user. They are
often used in forms, search bars, navigation menus, and other user interfaces where space is limited or where the number
of options is too large to display at once.

The primary dropdown should be used for the main or most important actions in the user interface.

Use only one primary dropdown. Any remaining calls to action should be represented as variants with lower emphasis.

The secondary dropdown should be used to provide additional options or actions to the user that are not as critical or
urgent as the primary actions.
