# Button

A button is a graphical control element that is used to trigger an action or event when the user clicks or taps on it.

Buttons can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, opening
a dialog box, or initiating a process.

Button width is set by its content. Avoid changing its width.

## Variants

### All variants at a glance

### Primary button

The primary button should be used for the main or most important action in the user interface. Its purpose is to
encourage users to take a specific action, such as submitting a form or initiating a new task.

Use only one primary button. Any remaining calls to action should be represented as variants with lower emphasis.

### Secondary button

The secondary button should be used to provide additional options or actions to the user that are not as critical or
urgent as the primary action. E.g.: "Cancel" or "Skip".

Do not use the secondary button without being accompanied by a primary button. It should be the negative or alternative
action to the primary.

### Tertiary button

The tertiary button should be used to provide a supplementary or tertiary action or option to the user. It doesn't need
need to be paired with another button since it can be an independent action. E.g.: "View more" or "View less".

### Link

The link button should be used as a secondary or tertiary button, or as a subtle call-to-action. Its purpose is to
draw attention to the button without being overly distracting, while also providing a clear call-to-action. It looks
like a link because the usage is very similar. E.g.: "Read More" or "Learn More".
