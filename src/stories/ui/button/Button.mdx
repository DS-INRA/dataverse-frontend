# Button

A button is a graphical control element that is used to trigger an action or event when the user clicks or taps on it.

Buttons can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, opening
a dialog box, or initiating a process.

## Usage

### General

- Button width is set by its content, avoid changing its width

### Primary

The primary button should be used as the main or most important action button in the user interface. Its purpose is to
encourage users to take a specific action, such as submitting a form, completing a purchase, or initiating a new task.

Use only one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons

### Secondary

The secondary button should be used to provide additional options or actions to the user that are not as critical or
urgent as the primary action. E.g.: “Cancel” or “Skip”.

Do not use the secondary button without being accompanied by a primary button. It should be the negative or alternative
action to the primary.

### Link/Ghost

The ghost button should be used as a secondary, or as a subtle call-to-action. Its purpose is to
draw attention to the button without being overly distracting, while also providing a clear call-to-action. It looks
like a link because the usage is very similar.

For example: "Read More", "Learn More" or "Subscribe" to a newsletter.
